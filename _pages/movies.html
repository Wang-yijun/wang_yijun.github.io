    This is a collection of movies created for Wang et&nbsp;al. (2025). The videos compare two 3-D subduction models
    side by side: one with a retreating trench and one with a stationary trench. The goal is to illustrate how these
    two settings generate different mantle-flow patterns and how those differences influence olivine texture evolution
    and anisotropic viscosity.

    Movie 1 — Cross section (particles placed on the cross section; poloidal flow): olivine texture evolution and anisotropy

    This movie shows a cross section through the center of the subduction zone. Viscosity is displayed as the background
    color, and the 3-D olivine texture orientation is overlaid as line segments. Orientations that are out of the plane
    appear as points, while in-plane orientations appear as lines at full length. Line color represents the strength of
    the olivine texture (and associated anisotropy): pink indicates a weak, dispersed texture, while yellow indicates a
    strong, well-aligned texture.

    Movie 2 — Cross section (particles placed on the cross section; poloidal flow): cluster assignment

    In Wang et&nbsp;al. (2025), we use time-series clustering to identify recurring patterns in olivine texture evolution
    and anisotropic viscosity in subduction zones. The input consists of time-series data for deformation, texture, and
    anisotropic viscosity; the output is a set of clusters based on the similarity of their temporal evolution. Particles
    within the same cluster therefore share similar histories of deformation, texture development, and anisotropic viscosity.
    In this movie, particles are colored by their cluster assignment to highlight regions with similar evolution histories.
